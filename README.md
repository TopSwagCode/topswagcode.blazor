A small project I have been working on for playing around with everything dotnet / azure. So far the project consists of:

* Blazor WASM Frontend (With AntBlazor for design)
* Aspnet Core API + SignalR
* Auth0 Authentication
* Azure function
* Azure cognitive services (face recognition)

Some of the paid services has been put behind Admin user role protection to keep hosting costs low :)
